You are designing a Smart Home Automation System where:

The SmartHome class contains:

A final static nested class Device, ensuring no subclass can modify device behavior.
A final static nested class Configuration, holding final static settings like MAX_POWER_LIMIT.
An abstract static class DeviceType, which:

Defines a method getDeviceCategory(), implemented by LightDevice and FanDevice.
Write a Java program that:

Defines a SmartHome class with:
A final static nested class Device that:
Has final static int MAX_DEVICES = 50;
Stores device details (ID and name).
Includes a final method getDeviceInfo(), returning device details.
A final static nested class Configuration, which:
Contains a final static int MAX_POWER_LIMIT = 5000;
Implements an abstract static class DeviceType with:
A method getDeviceCategory(), implemented in LightDevice and FanDevice.
The main() method should:
Create a device and display its details.
Display MAX_POWER_LIMIT from Configuration.
Create instances of LightDevice and FanDevice, and print their categories.
